# Finals-Lab-Task-6
- This task focuses on performing fundamental MongoDB operations such as creating a database, inserting documents, and executing find, update, search, and delete actions within a collection.

## Step-by-Step Process:

1. Create a Database

* Begin by generating or selecting a desired database.
* This chosen database serves as the main environment for the next operations.

2. Insert Documents

* A collection is established within the active database.
* Several documents are added, each holding organized information like name, age, or address.

3. FIND Documents

* Show all existing documents within the collection.
* Apply filters to retrieve specific documents using criteria such as name or ID.

4. UPDATE Documents

* Find the document to be updated based on a given condition (e.g., name or ID).
* Indicate the field(s) to modify and execute the update.
* Validate the change by reviewing the document again.

5. SEARCH Documents

* Define particular criteria to search for documents meeting set conditions (e.g., age over a specific number or a certain status).
* Check the returned documents to ensure they match the search requirements.

6. DELETE Documents

* Identify the document(s) to be removed using a condition.
* Remove the document(s) from the collection.
* Verify deletion by checking the collection contents.
